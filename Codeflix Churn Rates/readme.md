### SCHEMA
The marketing team are particularly interested in how the churn rates compare between two `segment` users. The dataset provided contains the subsciprtion data for the distinct channels.

The SQL table, __`subscriptions`__ , is used to assess the churn and has 4 columns;

- `id`Â - A unique identifier for the subscriber
- `subscription_start`Â - The start date for the subscription
- `subscription_end`Â - The end date for the subscription
- `segment`Â - This identifies which segment the subscriber belongs to


<aside>
 Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month

| page_name | TEXT |
| timestamp |	TEXT |
| user_id | INTEGER |
| utm_campaign | TEXT |
| utm_source|	TEXT |
| Rows: 5692 | 

-> SQL queries are used to explore the data and calculate top 5 campaigns with the highest % of purchases
